# Building a CubeSat: A Guide to Cube Satellites

## What is a CubeSat?

A CubeSat is a miniaturized satellite made up of standardized 10x10x10 cm cubic units. Each unit (1U) typically weighs less than 1.33 kg. CubeSats can be configured in larger sizes like 2U, 3U, or 6U.

## Key Components

### 1. Structure

- Aluminum frame and panels
